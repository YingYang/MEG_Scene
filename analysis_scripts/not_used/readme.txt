These implementations were created to do the same thing as Gretton's code, but I did not allow different "deg" or bandwidth for X and Y and each time point of Y. It turned out that the deg seems to be important to get reasonable results. So I depreciated these implementations and use the matlab implementation by Gretton instead.
