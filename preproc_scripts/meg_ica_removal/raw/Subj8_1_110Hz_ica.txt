# For Run 3,4,5,6,7, after ICA removal, there was still blinking effects remained. 
# probabily need to use the 1-50Hz ICs

# I decided to use all 1-50Hz IC components for this subject.  Checked Run1, the EOG/ECG components looked good. 
# ica objects obtained in Sept 05, 2015, on raw (not tsssed) data
# Subj8
# Automatically detected ECGs are all good
# Run3  EOG had wild slow drifting, MNE could not identify the correct one
# for Run10: ]   # the first attempt to do ICA used 10 as steps, but fast ICA did not converge.
